This tour sets up your first site on CloudCannon, showcases some of the features and demonstrates different editors.

Download the [creative site](/creative.zip) and follow along, or just read through the steps.
The creative site is a free HTML template enhanced with Jekyll features.

### Preparation

[Sign up](https://app.cloudcannon.com/users/sign_up) for a CloudCannon account, then create a new site from the *Sites List*:

1. Select **Add Site**
2. Type a name for your site (e.g. Creative)
3. Press **Enter** to confirm

---

### Adding Files

CloudCannon works directly with the static or Jeykll source files you provide. To upload the creative site source files:

1. Select the **Upload folder** option
2. Select the extracted **creative** folder

Alternatively, drag and drop files into the *File Browser*.
{: .info}

![File Browser with Add Files menu open](/img/overview/file-browser-add-menu.png){: .screenshot srcset="/img/overview/file-browser-add-menu.png 800w, /img/overview/file-browser-add-menu@2x.png 1600w"}

Some browsers do not support folder upload. The best alternative in this case is syncing with a storage provider.
{: .warning}

Each file uploads individually to CloudCannon through your web browser.
After the uploads finish, CloudCannon builds the site and deploys it to a test domain.

![File Browser with files](/img/overview/file-browser-complete.png){: .screenshot srcset="/img/overview/file-browser-complete.png 800w, /img/overview/file-browser-complete@2x.png 1600w"}

View the live site on the test domain by clicking the ***.cloudvent.net** link in the top left.

Keep a full history of changes and work on your local machine by syncing files with a storage provider instead.

### Inline Editing

Open the *Visual Editor* by selecting **Editor** in the left sidebar.

The *Visual Editor* is for making content changes inline on the website.
Yellow boxes indicate *Editable Regions* in each page.
Navigate around the site to make changes to other pages.

![Visual Editor](/img/overview/visual-editor.png){: .screenshot srcset="/img/overview/visual-editor.png 800w, /img/overview/visual-editor@2x.png 1600w"}

*Front Matter* is a Jekyll feature for defining custom metadata on a page (e.g. title or layout).
CloudCannon provides the *Settings Panel* to update front matter within the *Visual Editor*.
Open it with the **Toggle Settings** button in the top right for pages with front matter.

![Editing front matter in the Settings Panel](/img/overview/settings-panel.png){: .screenshot srcset="/img/overview/settings-panel.png 800w, /img/overview/settings-panel@2x.png 1600w"}

---

### Code Editing

The *Source Editor* provides developer-access to the raw source code of a file.
To open files in the source editor, open files from the *File Browser*, or select **Switch to Source Editor** in the top right of the *Visual Editor*.

If you're editing `/index.html`, the `h1` and `p` have `class="editable"`, defining those elements as editable in the *Visual Editor*.

![Source Editor](/img/overview/source-editor.png){: .screenshot srcset="/img/overview/source-editor.png 800w, /img/overview/source-editor@2x.png 1600w"}

Clients and non-developers don't have access to the *Source Editor*.
{: .info}

---

### Content Editing

Open the *Collections* section by selecting **Collections** in the left sidebar.
This section contains your pages, drafts, posts, collections items and data files.

![Collections section with Pages group open](/img/overview/pages.png){: .screenshot srcset="/img/overview/pages.png 800w, /img/overview/pages@2x.png 1600w"}

Select the **Drafts** group and open the **Second Blog Post** draft.
The draft opens in the *Content Editor*, a distraction-free WYSIWYG editor that saves to Markdown.

Draft posts are hidden on the live site until published. To publish the draft:

1. Make final edits to the main content and front matter
2. Select **Publish Post** in the top right

Make future changes to published posts with the *Content Editor* or inline with the *Visual Editor*.
{: .info}

![Content Editor](/img/overview/content-editor.png){: .screenshot srcset="/img/overview/content-editor.png 800w, /img/overview/content-editor@2x.png 1600w"}

Open the *Collections* section again and select the **Services** group.

Services is a Jekyll collection, a feature used to group related items in a scalable way.
This collection is for listing the services offered on the creative site.

![Collections section with Services group open](/img/overview/services.png){: .screenshot srcset="/img/overview/services.png 800w, /img/overview/services@2x.png 1600w"}

Open any of the collection items in *Services*.
Collection items are updated in the *Content Editor* the same way as drafts and posts.
