Internationalisation (I18n) in a web sense is the act of making your website more accessible to an international audience. This can be broken into two separate parts:

1. [Translation](/i18n/translation/): Serving the content in the language of the viewer
2. [Geolocation](/i18n/geolocation/): Personalising the content to give the most relevant content for that country

These are internationally separate as people living in a particular country does not guarantee they speak that language. Someone viewing a website from New Zealand (NZ) may be a visitor from Japan. If I18n is handled with the above separation, the website would show the NZ content in Japanese.


### Why I18n?

The short form I18n, can be broken down to the following:

1. "i" (the first letter of the word)
2. 18 characters
3. "n" (the last letter of the word)

This is a form of abbreviation known as a [Numeronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeronym). Globalisation (G11n) is sometimes used interchangeably with I18n.
