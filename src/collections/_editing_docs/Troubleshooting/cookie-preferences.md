When the visual editor is loaded, CloudCannon creates an authenticated connection to a domain proxee.co. This is a copy of your site, only accessible to editors of your site. Some browsers are stricter than others about how these two domains interact. To allow the visual editor to load you will need to relax cookie privileges on your browser for cloudcannon.com.
