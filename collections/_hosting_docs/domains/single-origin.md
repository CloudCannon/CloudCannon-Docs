In some cases, you may configure your DNS to point directly at CloudCannon's host origin, bypassing many of the normal benefits of CloudCannon hosting. This is not recommended, but fits a select *set* of use cases. Only use this if you have a specific reason to do so.

Click *Single Origin* under *Hosting / Domain* in your site settings. This will show you the DNS records you should use.
