Each page is different, but the process is the same: Create the relevant file in the root folder of your site Add the HTML for the page CloudCannon provides default, white-labelled pages for authentication. CloudCannon injects classes into the HTML to indicate the result of the action. They are injected into {{messageClasses}}. Use these classes to provide error handling and success notifications in your forms. For Jekyll-generated pages, use raw tags so Jekyll outputs it for CloudCannon to process later: {% raw %}{{messageClasses}}{% endraw %}. The customisable pages are listed below, with parameters and working examples.

To configure a manual build: Go to Site Settings Scheduled Builds Select the Manual tab Add a name Enter the date for the build to first run If you want the build to repeat on a regular interval, select a Repeat Interval Click Create Schedule to create a scheduled build.

To remove a build: Go to Site Settings Scheduled Builds Select the Manual tab Click Cancel on your selected build and then click again to confirm Automatic builds Automatic builds are configured by generating a _schedule.txt file in your Jekyll site. After a build CloudCannon will read your _schedule.txt file and automatically configure a build at the specified time. This is useful for future posts and any build that uses site.time. Installation To generate _schedule.txt we recommend using our plugin jekyll-cloudcannon-schedule`. This will parse all posts set for the future and generate a build on that date. If you would like to generate a custom file, see below for schedule file format. Add the following to your Gemfile: group :jekyll_plugins do gem 'jekyll-cloudcannon-schedule', '0.1.2' end Add the following to your _config.yml: plugins: - jekyll-cloudcannon-schedule If you are using a Jekyll version less than 3.5.0, use the gems key instead of plugins. Viewing automatic builds Once the plugin is configured, the site will be built automatically at the date of any future post. To view all available automatic builds: Go to Site Settings Scheduled Builds Select the Automatic tab Clicking Update will open the source filename in the content editor This is useful when configuring your initial plugin setup. Posts that are visible on the main site will not trigger a build. If automatic builds are not working, ensure –future is unchecked in Site Settings Build.

It contains three values: Run date Build name Source filename For example: 2020-10-22T10:00:00+00:00,Publish Post,_posts 2020-10-22-because-of-the-internet.md These values are used to schedule a build and generate the management UI.

CloudCannon provides an easy-to-use editor for front matter. Use the Toggle Settings button at top right of the Visual Editor or Content Editor to access it. There are interfaces for different types of content. Values and key naming conventions dictate which interfaces are used. Use these conventions to customise the editor for your team and clients. The available interfaces are listed below. Customise these interfaces further by adding sizes, formats, comments and defaults with Options. Text Single line field for text. Displayed for short text values. --- tagline: Hand-crafted clothing. --- Large Text Multiline text field expanded for longer text. Displayed for keys ending in _text or _description. Alternatively, you can use the variations without underscores as keys (e.g. description). --- description: Products are crafted in-house by hand, making each piece a labour of love and an exercise in craftsmanship. --- Rich Text WYSIWYG editor for formatted content. Displayed for keys ending in _html or _markdown. Alternatively, you can use the variations without underscores as keys (e.g. markdown). Each variation defines which format the value is saved as. --- markdown: | # Animals - Dogs - Cats &gt; It's raining cats and dogs. sidebar_html: | &lt;p&gt;This paragraph has &lt;em&gt;emphasis&lt; em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;strength&lt; strong&gt;.&lt; p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Walk&lt; li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Run&lt; li&gt; &lt; ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Linking to &lt;a href=\" \"&gt;index&lt; a&gt;.&lt; p&gt; --- Use the markdownify Liquid filter to render Markdown from front matter, e.g. {% if page.markdown %}{{ page.markdown | markdownify }}{% endif %}. Boolean Checkbox which can be triggered on or off. Displayed for the values true and false. --- show_feature: true --- File File, image and document selectors with controls to use external links and upload new files. Displayed for keys ending in _path, _document_path, _document, _image_path or _image. Alternatively, you can use the variations without underscores as keys (e.g. image_path or document). Each variation limits the files shown in the selector by type. The _path variation shows all visible files. --- background_image_path: images background.png newsletter_document_path: documents 2016 newsletter.pdf extra_styles_path: styles screen.css --- Control the size and format of image uploads with Image Upload Options. Colour Input with dropdown for selecting colour. Displayed for keys ending in _colour, _color, _rgb, _hex, _hsv and _hsl. Alternatively, you can use the variations without underscores as keys (e.g. rgb or colour). Each variation defines the preferred format of the colour. The _colour and _color variations default to hex. --- brand_colour: '#f05f40' --- Quote hex colours, otherwise the hash symbol begins a YAML comment. Number Input field for numbers. Displayed for number, keys ending in _number and numerical values. --- order: 12 number: 3.14 sort_number: 2 --- Code Block Configurable editor for blocks of code or monospace content. Displayed for code_block and keys ending in _code_block. Syntax highlighting is enabled when the suffix includes a language (e.g. javascript_code_block). --- code_block: | Some content is better in monospace. 1 + 1 = 2 2 + 2 = 4 javascript_code_block: | function sayHello() { console.log(\"Hi there!\"); } sayHello(); example_ruby_code_block: | def say_hello puts 'Hi there!' end say_hello --- Set a theme, tab size and more for each interface with code block Options. URL Input field with a preview for absolute or fully qualified URLs. Displayed for url, link and keys ending in _url or _link.

						"category": "",
						"url": " /i18n/internationalisation/",
						"content": "CloudCannon Internationalisation allows you to serve your site in different languages based on the viewers browser settings. Tagging content for translation First we must add a key to each element we want internationalised. To do this add a data-i18n attribute with a unique key. For example: &lt;h2 class=\"editable\" data-i18n=\"welcome_message\"&gt;Hello, welcome to my website&lt; h2&gt; Obtaining the current locale Once you have tagged the elements that need translation, CloudCannon can generate a lookup of the content. CloudCannon supports three file extensions: .json, .yml and .properties. These files are called locales. To obtain the current locale you can visit any of these URLs on your site: cms-current-locale.properties welcome_message = Hello, welcome to my website cms-current-locale.json {\"welcome_message\": \"Hello, welcome to my website\"} cms-current-locale.yml welcome_message: \"Hello, welcome to my website\" Providing alternative locales Once you have the current locale you can start creating new ones. For each new locale: Create the file with your chosen format (either .yml, .json or .properties). Name that file the locale that matches it. This locale should be a in the format language[_territory]. For example, general English is en and English specific to New Zealand should be en_NZ. Use the current locale as a template and update the values for the new locale. Add each file to the _locales directory in the root of your site. Here are some example locales: _locales de.properties welcome_message = Hallo, herzlich willkommen auf meiner Website _locales es.properties welcome_message = Hola, bienvenido a mi página web CloudCannon generates a new version of the HTML per locale and route visitors based on their accept-language header and country. Detecting the current locale CloudCannon automatically injects the viewers locale into the HTML elements class as it is served. If a site has en_NZ support and the viewer accepts that language it looks like: &lt;html class=\"language-en_nz\"&gt; Using CSS you can alter anything from font-size to text direction: * Arabic * .language-ar .content { direction: rtl; } Run some custom JavaScript based on language: var htmlElement = document.documentElement, languageClass = htmlElement.className.match( language-([^\\s]+)\\b ); if (languageClass) { console.log(languageClass[1]); logs your locale - check your console } else { console.log(\"Using default locale\"); }"

Download the creative site and follow along, or just read through the steps. The creative site is a free HTML template enhanced with Jekyll features. Preparation Sign up for a CloudCannon account, then create a new site from the Sites List: Select Add Site Type a name for your site (e.g. Creative) Press Enter to confirm Adding Files CloudCannon works directly with the static or Jeykll source files you provide. To upload the creative site source files: Select the Upload folder option Select the extracted creative folder Alternatively, drag and drop files into the File Browser. Some browsers do not support folder upload. The best alternative in this case is syncing with a storage provider. Each file uploads individually to CloudCannon through your web browser. After the uploads finish, CloudCannon builds the site and deploys it to a test domain. View the live site on the test domain by clicking the *.cloudvent.net link in the top left. Keep a full history of changes and work on your local machine by syncing files with a storage provider instead. Inline Editing Open the Visual Editor by selecting Edit in the left sidebar. The Visual Editor is for making content changes inline on the website. Yellow boxes indicate Editable Regions in each page. Navigate around the site to make changes to other pages. Front Matter is a Jekyll feature for defining custom metadata on a page (e.g. title or layout). CloudCannon provides the Settings Panel to update front matter within the Visual Editor. Open it with the Toggle Settings button in the top right for pages with front matter. Code Editing The Source Editor provides developer-access to the raw source code of a file. To open files in the source editor, open files from the File Browser, or select Switch to Source Editor in the top right of the Visual Editor. If you’re editing index.html, the h1 and p have class=\"editable\", defining those elements as editable in the Visual Editor. Clients and non-developers don’t have access to the Source Editor. Content Editing Open the Explore section by selecting Explore in the left sidebar. This section contains your pages, drafts, posts, collections items and data files. Select the Drafts group and open the Second Blog Post draft. The draft opens in the Content Editor, a distraction-free WYSIWYG editor that saves to Markdown. Draft posts are hidden on the live site until published. To publish the draft: Make final edits to the main content and front matter Select Publish Post in the top right Make future changes to published posts with the Content Editor or inline with the Visual Editor. Open the Explore section again and select the Services group. Services is a Jekyll collection, a feature used to group related items in a scalable way. This collection is for listing the services offered on the creative site. Open any of the collection items in Services. Collection items are updated in the Content Editor the same way as drafts and posts. Next Steps This tour only covers some of the features available to you. Explore the features CloudCannon offers at your own pace through this documentation. Extend this tour by providing editing access to clients with Client Sharing or look through the overview for a summary of each section. CloudCannon Academy has vast range of curated resources, guides and videos for Jekyll. Improving your Jekyll skills allows you to build better sites and editing experiences with CloudCannon for your team and clients.

I switched the plan to Free and the performance to CDN + Full optimizations: Now you need to update your nameservers. Log in to your domain provider and change the nameservers to the ones that CloudFlare gives you: Almost finished! Now go into your CloudFlare settings: Find the SSL section and change it to Flexible SSL: That’s it!

To upload files from the File Browser: Open the Add Files menu Select Upload files or Upload a folder Alternatively, drag and drop files into the File Browser. Uploading a folder uploads all files inside the folder, rather than the folder itself. Some browsers do not support folder upload. CloudCannon recommends syncing with a storage provider in this case. Each file uploads individually to CloudCannon through your web browser. Unsupported files are greyed out, while any files with errors uploading are shown red. If the site is synced with a storage provider, CloudCannon pushes the files there as well."

To connect a GitHub repository and start syncing files, follow these instructions: Go to Site Settings File Syncing and click Connect next to GitHub. This redirects you to GitHub. Enter your credentials to continue. Give CloudCannon access to your GitHub Account by clicking Authorize application. You can also Grant Access to any GitHub Organisations you wish to use in CloudCannon. You’ll be redirected back to CloudCannon to pick a repository to connect. If you don’t have one for this website, create a new one in GitHub and refresh this page. A dialog box warns you if there are existing files in your site. The files will be replaced with the contents of the repository. Click Connect GitHub to continue or close the dialog to cancel the process. GitHub is now connected. Changes you push to the Git repository are pulled in by CloudCannon. Any changes made on CloudCannon are automatically committed and pushed. Adding a new GitHub Organisation GitHub Organisations do not provide access to third parties applications. You’ll need to manually allow access to sync GitHub Organisation repositories with CloudCannon. To allow access, open the settings for the Organisation on GitHub and go to the Third-party access tab. Click on your own authorised applications under the No pending requests header. Click the Edit button next to CloudCannon. Click Grant Access. You should now be able to sync repositories owned by the GitHub Organisation in CloudCannon."

Selecting a publish branch enables the publish interface for your site. This is useful for staging sites. To connect a publish branch and enable publishing, follow these instructions: Go to Site Settings File Syncing Publish and click Add Publish Branch next to GitHub. Select the branch you want to merge into and click Use Branch. This will fail if there is no additional branch in the repository. All editors will have access to the Publish option in the sidebar. Clicking Publish Latest Changes will attempt a merge from the syncing branch to the publish branch. If there are any changes pending these will be displayed below the publish button. Removing a publish branch Go to Site Settings File Syncing Publish and click Remove Publish Branch next to GitHub. The publish interface becomes unavailable to all editors without a publish branch set. Publish mode The publish mode determines if publish is a direct merge or a pull request. Merges have less overhead, while pull requests can link to external builds, checks and workflows. To change the publish mode for a GitHub-connected site: Go to Site Settings File Syncing Publish Select Merge or Pull Request Click Change Publish Mode Publish requests Pull requests are called Publish Requests in CloudCannon to better fit the publish workflow for editors. Publish Requests provide an intermediate step for publishing, where external services connected to the GitHub Status API check the changes pass your requirements. Any pull requests that are not from the connected branch to publish branch are hidden in CloudCannon. The workflow with this publish mode is: Make changes to site Create a Publish Request Review the request, along with any checks from the GitHub Status API Publish or Close the request Publish merges the changes into the publish branch, while Close cancels the Publish Request. Changes made are not reversed after closing a Publish Request."
