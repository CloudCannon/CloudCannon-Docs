Translating is the second step in the i18n process. For each required language, a locale file must be generated. This locale file must match the same structure as source locale (generated in Tagging).

We recommend using [Smartling](https://www.smartling.com/) or equivalent product. This will manage the process of translation and ensure the exported files are correct.

> YO! I don't know much about this end very much. We will try flesh this out later.
