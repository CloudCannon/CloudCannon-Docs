The developer share level is for sharing a site to technical team members with CloudCannon accounts.

Developers have access to all files, editors and sections except owner-specific settings in *Site Settings*.

To share a site with a developer:

1. Go to the *Site Settings* / *Sharing* section
2. Enter the user's email address
3. Select **Developer** as the *Permission Level*
4. Click **Add Share**

![Sharing with a developer](/images/sharing/developer.png){: srcset="/images/sharing/developer.png 800w, /images/sharing/developer@2x.png 1600w"}
{: .has-screenshot}

> Team members shared on other sites appear in the interface for quick sharing.

To remove a user's access or change the *Permission Level*, click the **Edit** button on the right of the relevant users summary.
