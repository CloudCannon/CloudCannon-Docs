The non-developer share level is for sharing a site to non-technical team members with CloudCannon accounts.

Non-developers make content changes with the [Visual Editor](/editing/visual-editor/), [Content Editor](/editing/content-editor/) and *Collections* section.
They have access to the recent activity in the *Status* section.
The [Source Editor](/editing/source-editor/) and *File Browser* are hidden and inaccessible.

> Sharing with a non-developer increases the users on your plan. Use [Client Sharing](/sharing/client-sharing/) to share sites with clients at no additional cost.

To share with a site with a non-developer:

1. Go to the *Site Settings* / *Sharing* section
2. Enter the user's email address
3. Choose **Non-Developer** as the *Permission Level*
4. Click **Add Share**

> Team members shared on other sites appear in the interface for quick sharing.

To remove a user's access or change the *Permission Level*, click the **Edit** button on the right of the relevant users summary.
