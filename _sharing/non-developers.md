The non-developer share level is for sharing a site to non-technical team members with CloudCannon accounts.

Non-developers make content changes with the [Visual Editor](/editing/visual-editor/), [Content Editor](/editing/content-editor/) and *Collections* section.
They have access to the recent activity in the *Status* section.
The [Source Editor](/editing/source-editor/) and *File Browser* are hidden and inaccessible.

Sharing with a non-developer increases the users on your plan. Use [Client Sharing](/sharing/client-sharing/) to share sites with clients at no additional cost.
